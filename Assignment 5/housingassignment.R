# datadictonary
# price represents the sale price of a house in Rs.
# area gives the total size of a property in square feet
# bedrooms represents the number of bedrooms
# bathrooms shows the number of bathrooms
# stories variable shows the number of stories excluding basement
# mainroad =1 if the house faces a main road
# livingroom   = 1 if the house has a separate living room or a drawing room for guests
# basement shows if the house has a basement
# hotwaterheating  = 1 if the house uses gas for hot water heating
# airconditioning    = 1 if there is central air conditioning
# parking shoes the number of cars that can be parked
# prefarea is 1 if the house is located in the preferred neighbourhood of the city

Desc(housing$area,main = "area Distrubution") ###### Data having Outliers and looks it's Right Skewed
Desc(factor(housing$bedrooms),main = "bedrooms Distrubution") #### Most of the Level is "3"

Desc(factor(housing$stories),main = "stories Distrubution")#### Most of the Level is "2"
Desc(housing$mainroad,main = "mainroad Distrubution")### 80% of Houses having "YES-Main Road available"

Desc(housing$hotwaterheating,main = "hotwaterheating Distrubution")### above 90% of Houses having "NO hotwaterheating"
Desc(housing$airconditioning,main = "airconditioning Distrubution")### Nearly 70% of Houses having "NO airconditioning"
Desc(factor(housing$parking),main = "parking Distrubution")### Most of the Houses are "0 No Car parking"
Desc(housing$prefarea,main = "prefarea Distrubution")### above 70% Prefarea area is NO

#### Please note for this Casestudy we are following the stepwise regression to identify the Sig.. Variable 
#### insted of Doing this We need to use StepAIC will get the same output....
